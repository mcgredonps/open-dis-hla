====================================================
Building and Executing the Portico Example Federates
====================================================

The Example Federate
--------------------
The example federate is designed to demonstrate how to:

1) Publish and Subscribe
2) Register and delete an object
3) Update attribute values
4) Send an interaction
5) Advance time
6) Use synchronization points

The federate starts up and after going through setup (publication and subscription, enabling
time regulation and constrained etc...) it advances time from 1-10 in 1.0 increments. Each step
it will update the attributes of an object it has registered and will send an interaction. When
it receives a reflection or an update, it will log this information to screen.

You can run multiple instances of the example federate at once by starting each with a different
name. This is useful to see that all federates are communicating with one another. If they are,
you should be print-outs for the information received by each federate from the others.

Compiling the Federate
----------------------
Portico ships with a pre-compiled version of each Java example federate, but users will have to
compile the C++ versions for themselves with their compiler of choice.

Each federate comes with helper scripts to do the compilation for you. Note that if you are using
Java you must have JAVA_HOME set and javac must be available from the command line. If you are
using C++, your compiler and all relevant libraries must be available from the command line.

On windows you can use the helper batch files in %RTI_HOME%\bin\win32 to set up the environment
for various versions of Visual Studio if they have been installed into the default locations.

You can also set the RTI_HOME environment variable manually if you want. If you don't set this
variable, the scripts will warn you and then guess at where RTI_HOME is located. As long as you
are executing the scripts from the directory where they reside (RTI_HOME\examples\...) then you
will be OK.

To compile the examples, invoke the appropriate script with the "compile" argument:

win32 compile


Running the Federate
--------------------
As with compiling, if you are using Java you must have JAVA_HOME set and "java" available from
the command line. You can also set RTI_HOME if you want.

To run the example federate, use the appropriate script:

win32 execute [federateName]

The "federateName" argument is optional. If you are running more than one federate at once, make
sure you give each of them different names.
