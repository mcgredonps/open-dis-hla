If you are reading this, you are most likely looking around for the Portico
source code. Well, you can stop looking because it isn't in here!

The Portico build environment is quite large, and to ship it to you would
mean the size of the download would at least triple.

As such, if you are one of the few people who want the source code, you can
check it out of the public Sourceforge Subversion repository. For instructions
on how to do this, see the following:

http://porticoproject.org/index.php?title=Source_Code

For information on how to build Portico, see:

If you have any more questions, be sure to ask them!! Just jump on the forums
and we'll do our best to get everything sorted out:
