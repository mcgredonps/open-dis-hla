Welcome to Portico!!

=================================== SPECIAL NOTE ===================================
As of v0.9, Portico no longer uses a central RTI to run. All federates operate in a
peer-to-peer manner so there is NO NEED TO START AN RTI.
====================================================================================

1. Getting Started
-------------------
   You should have the following environment variables set before running Portico federates:

   RTI_HOME       : Points to the same directory this file is in
   JAVA_HOME      : Points to your java install**
   PATH           : (win32-only) Add %RTI_HOME%\bin and JVM libraries** to your existing path
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH: (linux-only) Add $RTI_HOME/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH

   ** If you installed the windows standalone version of Portico, a JRE came with it. In this
      case you can point JAVA_HOME at %RTI_HOME%\jre. To run federates, the JVM dlls must be
	  on your PATH. Add %RTI_HOME%\jre\bin\client to the PATH or sub in your JAVA_HOME (just
	  look for the directory with jvm.dll in it)


2. Writing Federates for Portico
--------------------------------
   Portico ships with some example federates if you don't have much HLA experience. For
   complete instructions on writing federates for Portico, see the website:

   http://porticoproject.org/index.php?title=Writing_Federates_for_Portico

   -Writing Java Federates-
    All the code necessary to write/run a Java federate is in the RTI_HOME\lib\portico.jar
    file. Just throw it on your classpath.

   -Writing C++ Federates-
    Portico uses JNI to provide a C++ interface wrapper around the main Java library.
    The Portico C++ interface is binary drop-in compatible with RTI-NG6 on windows.

      The header files are located in RTI_HOME\include\ng6
      The .lib and .so files are located in RTI_HOME\lib
	  The dlls are located in RTI_HOME\bin


3. Example Federates
--------------------
   Portico ships with some example federates for both Java and C++. Code and helper scripts
   are located in the RTI_HOME/examples directory.

   Each example federate has helper scripts/batch files to aid in building and running the
   federate. The scripts are either "linux.sh" or "win32.bat". The arguments they take are
   identical for both (linux used in these examples):

   ./linux.sh compile  => compile the code for the federate
   ./linux.sh execute  => run the federate. You can pass an optional argument specifying the
                          name for the federate (so you can run multiple instances if you wish)
   ./linux.sh clean    => remove all the code/jars that were created

   **NOTE** If you want to compile the Java federates, you'll need to have the JDK installed.
            The JRE that ships with the standalone version of Portico on windows is not sufficient

   **NOTE** If you want to build the C++ example federates, you will need to have a supported
            compiler installed (vc6, vc7, gcc4) and have your environment set up for it. On
			windows you can run the win32.bat file from a "Visual Studio Command Prompt", or,
			if you have vc6/7 installed in the default locations, there are batch files to
			set up the environment in RTI_HOME\bin\win32. If you just run one of these batch
			files in the prompt before trying to build, you'll be fine.


4. Documentation and Help
-------------------------
   There are three main resources for documentation and help:

     http://porticoproject.org
     Documentation about using and developing for Portico, in addition to
	 architectural documentation
	 
	 http://forums.porticoproject.org
     Get your questions answered here. I prefer this to a mailing list as it is easier
	 to search and navigate than the list archives. If you have a question, check the website
	 or forums first to see if someone else has had the same problem previously!
	 
	 https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/portico-user
     The user mailing list you can join to ask questions about portico and let us know about
	 problems, bugs or patches that you have!


So there you go, we hope you enjoy using Portico :)
